Waldorf Blofeld Editor & Librarian is designed to control your Waldorf Blofeld right from your DAW. With our Editor, you can work with your Waldorf Blofeld by the same way you use your virtual instrument plug-ins. Our Editor will recall your patch settings when you open your project and the data will be sent to your Blofeld automatically once you open your project. Your synthesizer is always synchronized with your session! The only thing you need to worry, is that you power-up your synthesizer.
